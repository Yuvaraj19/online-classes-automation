# online-classes-automation

'Online classes automationâ€™ is a simple application with simple
graphics. In this project, I tried Automating a repetitive task that is Joining online classes 
everyday. 
I created a simple interface using tkinter (a python library for making interfaces), It has 
2 buttons and a Checkbox, Buttons are Start and Quit, for Starting and Quitting the automatic 
bot, Which joins classes Automatically and Quit simply exits the Application.
And the checkbox is for whether the Users want the bot to send notifications to WhatsApp 
after it joins and leaves every class.
If the checkbox is set then after every class bot joins and leaves it puts a message in 
WhatsApp like : Sub1 : joined, Sub1 : completed and so on.

Note : Many changes have to be done on the code of this project, for it to work for you.
(Time table should be updated, urls should be added and some respective changes in code 
and maybe more depending on your time table, So if any difficulty faced and if it does'nt work 
for you, don't hesitate to contact me, I'll be pleased to help you.)
